# Overview

This is a minimal Express.js server application that provides a foundation for building web APIs. The project is currently in its early stages with a single root endpoint that returns a JSON health check response. The server is configured to run on port 5000 and listen on all network interfaces, making it suitable for containerized deployments.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Backend Architecture

**Framework Choice: Express.js 5.x**

The application uses Express.js as its web server framework, specifically version 5.1.0. This is the latest major version of Express, which offers improved performance and modern JavaScript features.

**Problem Addressed:** Need for a lightweight, flexible web server framework with robust routing and middleware capabilities.

**Chosen Solution:** Express.js provides a minimal, unopinionated framework that allows for rapid API development while maintaining flexibility for future growth.

**Architectural Decisions:**
- **Single Entry Point:** The application uses `index.js` as the main entry point, keeping the structure simple and straightforward
- **JSON API:** The server is configured with `express.json()` middleware, indicating it's designed to handle JSON request/response payloads
- **Port Configuration:** Hardcoded to port 5000 with `0.0.0.0` binding for broad network accessibility

**Pros:**
- Simple, easy to understand structure
- Minimal dependencies reduce attack surface and maintenance burden
- Express.js has extensive community support and documentation

**Cons:**
- No environment-based configuration yet (port is hardcoded)
- Lacks structure for scaling (no separation of routes, controllers, etc.)
- No error handling middleware implemented

## Data Layer

**Current State:** No database or data persistence layer is currently implemented.

**Future Considerations:** The architecture is open to any database solution (SQL or NoSQL). Common patterns would involve adding an ORM/ODM in a separate data access layer.

## API Structure

**Current Endpoints:**
- `GET /` - Health check endpoint returning server status

**Design Pattern:** RESTful API approach, though only a single endpoint exists currently.

**Expected Growth:** The current flat structure suggests future routes should be organized into separate router modules as the application grows.

## Middleware Stack

**Current Middleware:**
- `express.json()` - Parses incoming JSON payloads

**Missing Common Middleware:**
- CORS handling
- Request logging
- Error handling
- Security headers (helmet)
- Rate limiting

## Security & Authentication

**Current State:** No authentication or authorization mechanisms are implemented.

**Considerations:** The open architecture allows for any authentication strategy (JWT, session-based, OAuth, etc.) to be added later.

# External Dependencies

## Runtime Dependencies

**express (^5.1.0)**
- Purpose: Core web server framework
- Type: Runtime dependency
- Critical: Yes - this is the foundation of the application

## Development & Infrastructure

**Node.js Runtime:** Required (version not specified in package.json, but Express 5.x typically requires Node 18+)

## Missing Common Dependencies

The following are typically needed for production applications but not yet included:
- Environment variable management (dotenv)
- Logging framework (winston, pino)
- Security middleware (helmet, cors)
- Testing framework (jest, mocha)
- Database client/ORM (if data persistence is needed)

## No External Services Currently Integrated

The application does not currently integrate with any external APIs, cloud services, or third-party platforms. It's a self-contained server with no outbound dependencies.
